# Claude Code Instructions — OpenSpec Project

## OpenSpec Status Check (run this first on every session start)

Before doing any other work, check whether this project has been configured:

```bash
grep -c '{{' .openspec/config.yaml 2>/dev/null && echo "STATUS: NOT_CONFIGURED" || echo "STATUS: CONFIGURED"
```

- **`NOT_CONFIGURED`** → Follow "First-Time Setup" below before anything else.
- **`CONFIGURED`** → Skip to "Working on Features".

---

## First-Time Setup (AI-Guided Onboarding)

This project was created with OpenSpec enforcement, but `.openspec/config.yaml`
still has placeholder values that need to be filled in.

**Step 1 — Read the question schema and personal defaults:**
Read `.openspec/onboarding.yaml` and `.openspec/defaults.yaml`.
Any field already set in `defaults.yaml` (non-empty, non-placeholder) can be
skipped in the interview — use that value directly in `config.yaml`.

**Step 2 — Interview the user:**
Ask each `required: true` question that is not already answered in `defaults.yaml`.
For `required: false` questions, show the default and let the user accept or change it.

**Step 3 — Write the config:**
Edit `.openspec/config.yaml`, replacing each `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` token with the
user's answer. For boolean fields, write `true` or `false` (no quotes).

**Step 4 — Scaffold the first spec (if the user named a feature):**
```bash
gh openspec scaffold "<feature-name>"
```
Show the user the created file and offer to help fill in `acceptance_criteria`.

**Step 5 — Confirm setup is complete:**
```bash
grep -c '{{' .openspec/config.yaml
```
If output is `0`, configuration is complete. Tell the user:
> "OpenSpec is configured. Run `bash setup.sh` to install git hooks.
>  After that, any commit touching source files will require a spec."

**Step 6 — Create or update README.md and substitute placeholders in governance files:**

After configuration is complete:

1. Create or update `README.md` with:
   - Project name and description (from `config.yaml`)
   - How to install/run the project
   - How OpenSpec works in this repo (brief overview)
   - Link to `.openspec/` for spec details

2. Substitute placeholders across the governance files shipped with this
   template. A single find-and-replace per token covers every file:

   | Token | Replace with | Files |
   |---|---|---|
   | `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` | Project name | README, SECURITY, CONTRIBUTING, SUPPORT, CHANGELOG, devcontainer |
   | `{{GITHUB_OWNER}}` | GitHub org/user | CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG, CODEOWNERS, ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml |
   | `{{TEAM_NAME}}` | GitHub team slug | CODEOWNERS |
   | `{{SECURITY_CONTACT}}` | Security contact email | SECURITY, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SUPPORT |
   | `{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}` | One-line description | README |
   | `{{BADGES}}` | shields.io badge line (auto-generated from `tech_stack`) | README |
   | `{{TECH_STACK}}` | Comma-separated tech list | config.yaml |

3. **Generate badges from `tech_stack`:**

   Read `project.tech_stack` from `config.yaml`. For each comma-separated
   value, look up the matching badge from the catalog below and concatenate
   them into a single line separated by spaces. Replace `{{BADGES}}` in
   `README.md` with the result. If `tech_stack` is empty, remove the
   `{{BADGES}}` line entirely.

   Always append the OpenSpec and License badges at the end:
   ```
   ![OpenSpec](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenSpec-enforced-blueviolet)
   ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)
   ```

   If a `tech_stack` value has no catalog match, generate a generic gray badge:
   ```
   ![<Value>](https://img.shields.io/badge/<Value>-gray)
   ```

4. Review `.github/CODEOWNERS` — add finer-grained per-path owners as the
   codebase grows. Default ownership is the team from `{{TEAM_NAME}}`.

5. Point the user to `docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md` to configure required
   status checks (OpenSpec PR Check, CodeQL, gitleaks, dependency-review)
   on the default branch.

Do not write any production code until the config has no `{{` tokens.

---

## Working on Features

When the user asks you to implement something new:

1. **Check for an existing spec:**
   ```bash
   ls .openspec/specs/
   ```
   Look for a `<feature-slug>.spec.yaml` file matching the requested feature.
   Alternatively, run `/openspec-check` to validate current coverage.

2. **If no spec exists — create one first:**
   ```bash
   gh openspec scaffold "<feature-name>"
   # or in Claude Code:
   /openspec-scaffold <feature-name>
   ```
   Ask the user to confirm or fill in:
   - `description`: what this does and why
   - `acceptance_criteria`: definition of done (at least one item)
   - `test_plan`: at least one test per AC
   - `implementation_skill`: optional — check `agents.implementation_skills` in `config.yaml` for available domain skills
   - `out_of_scope`: what this explicitly does NOT cover

3. **Do not write production code** until the spec has at least one
   `acceptance_criteria` item, at least one `test_plan` item, and `status`
   is `review` or `approved`.

4. **Check for a domain skill** — read `implementation_skill` in the spec.
   If set, invoke that skill before writing code. If null, check
   `agents.implementation_skills.default` in `config.yaml`.

5. **Use the spec as your definition of done.**
   Each acceptance criterion should be verifiable in the implementation.
   Use `/openspec-implement <slug>` to drive the full workflow.

6. **Write tests alongside the implementation.**
   Every spec requires a `test_plan`. Tests must be written as part of the
   same PR — not as a follow-up. CI will fail if tests are missing or failing.

7. **Commit the spec with the implementation:**
   Include the `.openspec/specs/<slug>.spec.yaml` file in the same commit
   (or PR) as the production code changes.

8. **Update README.md** to reflect any new features, changed behavior, or
   new usage instructions introduced by the implementation.

## Validating Spec Coverage

```bash
gh openspec check           # validate all specs in this repo
gh openspec check --strict  # treat warnings as errors
gh openspec check --pr 42   # check spec coverage for PR #42
```

---

## Scaffolding a New Spec Manually

```bash
gh openspec scaffold "user authentication"         # feature spec
gh openspec scaffold "fix login crash" --type bugfix  # bugfix spec
```

Spec files are created at `.openspec/specs/<slug>.spec.yaml`.

## Coding Guidelines (Karpathy)

> These guidelines reduce common LLM coding mistakes. They bias toward caution over speed — use judgment on trivial tasks.
> OpenSpec already handles **Goal-Driven Execution**: `acceptance_criteria` are your success criteria and `test_plan` items are your verification steps. The guidelines below cover what OpenSpec does not.

### 1. Think Before Coding

Before writing a single line of implementation:

- **State your assumptions explicitly.** If uncertain about what the spec means, ask — don't guess silently.
- **If multiple interpretations exist**, present them to the user. Don't pick one without saying so.
- **If a simpler approach exists**, say so. Push back on the spec if the design is overcomplicated.
- **If something is unclear**, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask. Do not hide confusion behind code.
- Surface assumptions during spec creation or spec review — not mid-implementation.

### 2. Simplicity First

Write the minimum code that satisfies each acceptance criterion. Nothing more.

- No features beyond what the AC requires.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that the spec didn't ask for.
- No error handling for scenarios that cannot happen given the spec's stated context.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.
- Ask yourself: *"Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?"* If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

Touch only what the spec requires. Clean up only your own mess.

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting that is not part of the spec.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken unless the spec explicitly asks for it.
- Match existing code style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.
- When your changes create orphans (unused imports, variables, functions), remove them.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.
- **The test:** every changed line should trace directly to an acceptance criterion in the spec.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution (OpenSpec integration)

OpenSpec enforces this structurally. Map each implementation step to a spec artifact:

- Each AC → a verifiable code change
- Each `test_plan` item → a written test in the same PR
- Multi-step tasks → state a brief plan before starting:
  ```
  [Step] → verify: [AC reference]
  [Step] → verify: [test_plan item]
  ```
- Weak criteria ("make it work") → go back to the spec and sharpen the AC before coding.

---

## Testing & QA Standards

Every feature or bugfix implemented through OpenSpec **must** include tests. This is enforced at the spec, commit, and CI levels.

### Spec requirements
- Every spec must have a `test_plan` section with at least one item before status moves to `review`.
- `test_plan` items should map 1-to-1 with `acceptance_criteria` where possible.
- Bugfix specs must also fill in `regression_test` with the specific file/function added.

### Implementation requirements
- Write unit tests for all new logic.
- Write integration tests for any new API endpoints, data flows, or cross-service interactions.
- Do not merge a spec without its tests — CI blocks on missing or failing tests.

### CI gates
The following CI checks are enforced (configured in `.openspec/config.yaml`):
- `ci.run_tests: true` — test suite runs on every PR.
- `ci.fail_on_test_failure: true` — failing tests block merge.
- `ci.fail_on_missing_tests: true` — PRs with no test changes alongside source changes are flagged.

### Running tests locally
```bash
# Use the test command configured during onboarding (testing.test_command in config.yaml)
# Examples:
npm test
pytest
go test ./...
```

---

## Documentation Standards

### README.md
- Always create `README.md` during first-time setup (Step 6 above).
- Always update `README.md` when implementing a feature or fixing a bug that changes behavior or usage.
- Keep it accurate and up to date — it is the entry point for any developer opening this repo.

### Diagrams
- **Always use [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) syntax** for any diagrams (flowcharts, sequence diagrams, ERDs, etc.).
- Mermaid renders natively on GitHub inside fenced code blocks:
  ````
  ```mermaid
  graph TD
      A[Start] --> B[End]
  ```
  ````
- Do **not** use image-based diagrams (PNG, SVG files, external tools) unless the user explicitly requests it.
- Place diagrams directly in `README.md` or in the relevant spec/doc file where they add the most clarity.

---

## Project Context

- **Config**: `.openspec/config.yaml` ← fill this in during onboarding
- **Spec templates**: `.openspec/templates/`
- **Active specs**: `.openspec/specs/`
